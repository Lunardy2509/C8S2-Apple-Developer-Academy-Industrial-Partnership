# Female Daily x Apple Developer Academy â€” iOS Navigation Solution (Proof of Concept)

This repository contains the deliverables and development artifacts from a one-month sprint collaboration with **Female Daily**, an industry partner of the Apple Developer Academy @BINUS. The project focused on solving navigation and usability challenges through a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** iOS solution.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The primary objective of this project was to ideate, design, and prototype an iOS application that addresses key user pain points in navigation within the Female Daily platform. Through agile, one-month sprint cycles, we moved rapidly from early concept sketches to **High-Fidelity UI prototypes** and a functional **iOS app prototype**.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Swift + SwiftUI**
- **Xcode**
- **Figma** (for High-Fidelity UI Prototyping)
- **Core Apple Frameworks** (GeoJSON, MapKit, CoreLocation, CoreData)
- **Agile Development Practices**

## ðŸ§© Features Explored

- Context-aware navigation system
- Seamless page transitions mimicking native app behavior
- User-centric layout and hierarchy restructuring
- Modular UI components for rapid iteration

## ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration

This project was made possible through the Apple Developer Academyâ€™s **Industrial Partnership** initiative. Female Daily provided the business problem and product insights, while our team executed the UX research, design decisions, and technical development.
